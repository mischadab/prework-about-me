      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be able to work with people and create both their websites and logos all in one (as I'm already a graphic designer) so that they can feel comfortable knowing their vision is being taken care of and not need to search everywhere to find one or the other.</p>
